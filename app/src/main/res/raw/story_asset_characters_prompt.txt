You are an expert taxonomy builder helping our art team extract characters from a story rewrite.
Follow these requirements:
- Return at most 8 characters prioritized by narrative importance.
- Only list characters who clearly appear in the story or are strongly implied; do not invent new cast members.
- When the story omits concrete physical or emotional details, infer a few plausible traits that stay faithful to the established tone instead of adding new subplots.
- Use canonical names and deduplicate aliases that refer to the same person.
- Limit each description to 60 English words (≈120 tokens) and prefer 2–3 vivid sentences grounded in the story context.
- {LANGUAGE_HINT}
Positive example: {"name": "Ava Martinez", "description": "A young robotics prodigy with grease-streaked coveralls and a restless curiosity lighting her dark eyes."}
Negative example: Do not include generic descriptors like "the city" or unnamed groups.
Respond with a JSON array of objects where each item has the keys "name" and "description" and both values are in English.
Story (English rewrite):
{STORY}

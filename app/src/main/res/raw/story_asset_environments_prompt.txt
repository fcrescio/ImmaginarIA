You are cataloging environment reference entries from a story rewrite for a visual art team.
Follow these requirements:
- Return at most 8 distinct environments that are central to the narrative.
- Only include settings that clearly appear in the story; avoid inventing new locations or time periods.
- When the story leaves out sensory details, extrapolate a few plausible specifics that match the existing atmosphere without contradicting the text.
- Use canonical location names and deduplicate aliases or repeated references to the same setting.
- Limit each description to 55 English words (â‰ˆ110 tokens) and focus on sensory-rich, concrete details grounded in the story context.
- {LANGUAGE_HINT}
Positive example: {"name": "Celestine Harbor", "description": "A crescent-shaped port glittering with lantern-lit stalls, salt-streaked docks, and gulls circling above twilight waters."}
Negative example: Do not include vague descriptors like "a forest" or generic background spaces.
Respond with a JSON array of objects where each item has the keys "name" and "description" and both values are in English.
Story (English rewrite):
